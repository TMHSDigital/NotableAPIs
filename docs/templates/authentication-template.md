# [API Name] Authentication

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up and using authentication with the [API Name] API.

## Authentication Method

[API Name] uses [authentication method(s): API Key, OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth, etc.] for authenticating API requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you can authenticate with the API, you will need:

- [Prerequisite 1, e.g., "An account on the provider's platform"]
- [Prerequisite 2, e.g., "A registered application"]
- [Additional requirements]

2. [Instructions for creating an account or registering an application]
3. [Additional steps as needed]

### Step 2: [Obtain Credentials]

1. [Navigate to credentials section]
2. [Instructions for generating API keys, client IDs, etc.]
3. [Information on credential types and roles]

### Step 3: [Configure Authentication]

1. [Instructions for configuring authentication in your application]
2. [Environment setup guidelines]
3. [Best practices for credential storage]

## Authentication Examples
