# NotableAPIs

Welcome to the **NotableAPIs** repository, a curated collection of APIs organized by pricing model, functionality, and provider. This repository aims to provide developers with a one-stop resource to explore, understand, and integrate various APIs into their projects.

## Repository Structure

- **apis/** - Contains detailed information about APIs categorized by their pricing model.
  - **free/** - APIs that are free to use with no limitations or just basic usage limits.
  - **freemium/** - APIs with free tiers but offer paid options for additional features or higher limits.
  - **paid/** - APIs that require payment for any level of use.
  - **tools_and_platforms/** - Platforms or tools that manage or facilitate API usage.

- **categories/** - APIs organized by their function or industry (e.g., Finance, Weather, AI).

- **by-provider/** - Lists APIs by their provider or company (e.g., Google, Amazon).

- **docs/** - Documentation for contributors, guidelines, and general API usage information.

- **scripts/** - Utility scripts for managing or testing APIs.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand and update this repository. Here's how you can contribute:

- **Add New APIs**: If you know of an API not listed here, create a folder under the appropriate pricing model in `apis/` with a `README.md` describing the API's use, pricing, and example usage if possible.

- **Update Information**: Keep the API details current by updating existing `README.md` files with new pricing, features, or changes in service.

- **Fix Errors**: Found a typo or mistake? Feel free to create a pull request with the correction.

## How to Use This Repository

### Exploring APIs

- **By Pricing**: Look under `apis/` to find APIs based on whether they are free, freemium, or paid.
- **By Category**: Navigate to `categories/` to find APIs by their function or industry.
- **By Provider**: Use `by-provider/` to see all APIs from a specific company or service.

### Using APIs

Each API directory contains:

- **README.md**: Explanation of the API, its features, pricing, and often includes:
  - **Authentication**: How to get started with the API, including API keys or OAuth.
  - **Endpoints**: Key endpoints or methods available.
  - **Rate Limits**: Important for planning API usage.
  - **Examples**: Sometimes code snippets or curl commands for quick reference.

### Examples and Scripts

- **Scripts**: Check the `scripts/` directory for any tools or scripts provided to interact with APIs or manage API keys.

## API Documentation Standards

- **Consistency**: We aim for a consistent format in describing each API to make it easier for users to understand and compare.
- **Current Information**: We strive to keep API descriptions up-to-date, but always refer to the official API documentation for the most current information.
