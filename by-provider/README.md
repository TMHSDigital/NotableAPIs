# APIs by Provider

This directory organizes APIs by the company or organization that provides them. Use this structure to quickly find all APIs offered by a specific provider.

## How to Use

- Each subdirectory is named after a provider (e.g., `google`, `microsoft`, `aws`).
- Inside each provider directory, you'll find documentation for all APIs offered by that provider.
- Use this structure to compare offerings from the same company or to find related APIs.

## Example Providers

- Google
- Microsoft
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- IBM
- Twilio
- Stripe
- Meta (Facebook)
- Salesforce

## Navigation

Browse the subdirectories or use search to find a provider. For more details on each API, see the corresponding documentation in the `apis/` directory.
