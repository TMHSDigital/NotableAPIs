# APIs Directory

This directory contains detailed information about APIs organized by their pricing models. This structure helps developers quickly find APIs that fit their budget and usage requirements.

## Directory Structure

### [Free APIs](./free/)
APIs that are completely free to use or have very generous free tiers:
- No payment required
- May have rate limits
- Suitable for hobby projects and learning
- No credit card required

### [Freemium APIs](./freemium/)
APIs that offer both free and paid tiers:
- Free tier for basic usage
- Paid tiers for additional features/higher limits
- Clear upgrade paths
- Good for scaling projects

### [Paid APIs](./paid/)
APIs that require payment for any level of use:
- Professional services
- Enterprise solutions
- Premium features
- SLA guarantees

### [Tools and Platforms](./tools_and_platforms/)
Resources for API management and integration:
- API Gateways
- Testing Tools
- Monitoring Solutions
- Documentation Platforms

## API Documentation Format

Each API entry follows this structure:
```
api-name/
├── README.md           # Main documentation
├── authentication.md   # Auth setup and security
├── endpoints.md        # API endpoints reference
├── examples/          # Code examples
│   ├── python/
│   ├── javascript/
│   └── ...
└── pricing.md         # Detailed pricing info
```

### README.md Template
Each API's README.md should include:
- Brief description
- Key features
- Use cases
- Quick start guide
- Rate limits
- Links to official documentation
- Support contact information

## Adding New APIs

When adding a new API:
1. Determine the appropriate pricing category
2. Create a new directory using the API name
3. Follow the documentation format
4. Include working code examples
5. Verify all information is current
6. Add cross-references to categories and providers

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep pricing information up to date
- Regularly verify rate limits and features
- Update deprecated endpoints or features
- Maintain accurate cross-references
- Test code examples periodically
